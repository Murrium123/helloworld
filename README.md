Hello World- First Repository

Hi,

My name is Murrium and I was born in London city, UK. I am a Canadian by naturalization and I love Canada and England. I often work in the U.S. due to my industry being GIS. I love my personality and I wouldn't be anyone else to save my life. I used to be an actress years ago and it is this experience that gives me my excellent presentation skills. I would be an asset to any company that required a solid GIS technician. I hope to make my own GIS company one day. I am familiar with ArcGIS, QGIS, Python, HTML, CSS, and ERDAS. I would like to become more familiar with Java Script and C++.
